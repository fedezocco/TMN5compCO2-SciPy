# Circular Microalgae-Based Carbon Control for Net Zero
This repository contains the source code of the paper: Zocco, F., Garc√≠a, J. and Haddad, W.M., 2025. Circular microalgae-based carbon control for net zero. arXiv preprint: arXiv:2502.02382.

The repository contains 2 folders: one is for the Lyapunov-based control of the digester, the other is for the RL-based control of the microalgae cultivation. The Lyapunov-based control is implemented in a Python script (extension '.py'), whereas the RL controllers are implemented in Python notebooks (extension '.ipynb'). The notebooks are written and executed in Google Colaboratory (aka Colab) and the default storage location to save the training logs and the models is Google Drive. 

A note about the Python notebooks: GitHub does not show the training logs plotted with tensorboard. To see them, download the notebook and open it using Google Colab.
